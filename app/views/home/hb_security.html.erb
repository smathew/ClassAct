		Class Act FCU is committed to making sure that
		Home Branch is safe and secure. With our security
		infrastructure in place we are confident that access to 
		your accounts is private and secure. Be sure and <%= link_to "check out the Home Branch FAQ", hb_faq_path %> for other information.
	
		<p><strong>You play a role in security</strong></p>
	
		<p>While Class Act FCU works to protect your financial privacy, you also play a 
		role in protecting your accounts. There are a number of steps you can take to 
		ensure that your financial experience on the Internet is safe and secure.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Ways to protect yourself</strong></p>
	
		<p><ul><li>First and foremost, don't reveal your PIN to anyone else. Your PIN is
		designed to protect the privacy of your account information, but it will 
		only work if you keep it to yourself. If you think your PIN has been
		compromised, change it immediately online.</li>
		<li>Don't walk away from your computer if you are in the middle of a Home Branch session.</li>
		<li>When you are finished using Home Branch, always exit before visiting other Internet sites.</li>
		<li>If anyone else is likely to use your computer, clear your cache or turn off and re-initiate
		your browser in order to eliminate copies of web pages that have been stored in your
		hard drive. How you clear your cache will depend on the browser and version you
		have. This function is generally found in your preferences menu.</li>
		<li>Class Act FCU strongly recommends that you use a browser with 128-bit
		encryption to conduct secure financial transactions over the Internet. 
		You can download a <%= link_to "Netscape", "http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html", :rel=>"external" %> or 
		<%= link_to "Microsoft", "http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download" , :rel=>"external" %> browser that provides the highest level 
		of encryption commercially available.</li> 
		</ul></p>
		<p>
		<strong>Browser security/encryption</strong><p>Encryption helps protect your private information so that it cannot be intercepted and read by
		a third party. </p>
	
		<p>Encryption is the scrambling of information for transmission back and forth between two
		points. A virtual key is required to decode the information. When you request information about
		your accounts, the request is sent encrypted (scrambled) to Class Act FCU. We then decode your
		request for information and send it back to you in an encrypted format. 
		When you receive it, your information is automatically decoded so that you can read it.</p>
	
		<p>The encryption technology used by Home Branch is so secure that it is classified by 
		the U.S. Department of Defense and export of this technology to other countries is forbidden by law. </p>
	
		<p>You can download a <%= link_to "Netscape", "http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html", :rel=>"external" %> or 
		<%= link_to "Microsoft", "http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download" , :rel=>"external" %> browser that provides the highest level 
		of encryption commercially available.  
	
		<p>
		<strong>Digital identity</strong><p>For digital identity verification, we have a digital server certificate
		that your browser uses each time you sign on to verify that indeed you are
		connected to Class Act FCU. </p>
